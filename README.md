# Name Explorer

**Name Explorer** is a Shiny app for exploring "gender" of names over time.

### Purpose

This website comes from a project which aims to provide a dataset and tools for building informed linguistics example sentences and stimuli.

For example, the Name Explorer can help to:

- select gender-fair names, informed by participant age range
- find and select racially/ethnically representative names
- generate age-appropriate lists of gender-balanced (unisex) names
- identify names perceived to be (more) 'nonbinary' or 'binary'
- identify names perceived to be (more) 'young' or 'old' (relative to participants' age)
- identify names marked for other stereotypes (e.g. race, country of origin, socio-economic class)
- gather this information by region and by age, as these stereotypes can vary internationally and generationally
